# Neural Network to Recognize Handwritten Numbers

### About this project
This project was built in collaboration with a classmate. After my team won a Neural Networks workshop hosted by the IE chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs, our interest in neural networks was sparked. Building off the base code from the workshop, we were able to create a neural network that can accept a hand-drawn number and predict what number is depicted. We then deployed it to the web. 

### Technologies 
This project is coded in Python. Libraries used include: 🐼pandas | 🧮numpy | 📈matplotlib | 🥒pickle | 🎨streamlit | 🖼️PIL

### Future features
Our next planned step is to recreate this project using TensorFlow. 

### Deployed app
The deployed app URL is: (DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS)

### Files
- neural.py: The script for the deployed app
- trained_params.pkl: The file holding the trained parameters of the neural network
- .streamlit: This folder holds a configuration file for the streamlit app

# Neural Network to Recognize Handwritten Numbers

### About this project
This project was built in collaboration with a classmate. After my team won the coding challenge at a Neural Networks workshop hosted by the IE chapter of Google Developer Student Clubs, our interest in neural networks was sparked. Building off the base code from the workshop, we were able to create a neural network that does not utilize any ML libraries and that can accept a hand-drawn number and predict what number is depicted. We then deployed it to the web. 

### Technologies 
This project is coded in Python. Libraries used include: 🐼pandas | 🧮numpy | 📈matplotlib | 🥒pickle | 🎨streamlit | 🖼️PIL

### Future features
Our next planned step is to add additional datasets into the training data to increase accuracy of the model.

### Deployed app
The deployed app URL is: https://handwrittennumbers.streamlit.app/
